# GitApp - A React Website with Firebase Authentication and GitHub Integration

GitApp is a web application built using React that provides users with the functionality to sign up and sign in using Firebase authentication. Once logged in, users can search for a GitHub username and view the corresponding GitHub repositories and user details using the GitHub API.

## Key Features

- **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality powered by Firebase Authentication. Users can create an account, sign in with their credentials, and access the app's features.

- **GitHub API Integration:** The app utilizes the GitHub API to fetch repository information and user details based on the searched GitHub username. Users can easily explore public repositories and profiles.

- **GitHub Repository Search:** Users can enter a GitHub username in the search bar to find and view repositories associated with that user. The search results will include a list of repositories with essential information such as name, description, and link to the repository.

- **GitHub User Details:** In addition to repository details, the app also presents essential GitHub user information, including their profile picture, bio, followers, and following counts.

## How to Use

1. **Sign Up / Sign In:** Users can create a new account or sign in using their existing Firebase account credentials.

2. **Search GitHub Username:** Once logged in, users can enter a GitHub username in the search bar on their dashboard and click the search button.

3. **View GitHub Repositories:** The app will fetch and display a list of repositories associated with the searched GitHub username. Each repository card includes essential details and a link to the repository on GitHub.

4. **View GitHub User Details:** The app also shows information about the GitHub user, such as their profile picture, bio, followers, and following counts.

5. **Log Out:** Users can log out of their account to secure their session and data.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface and managing the application's frontend.
- Firebase: For user authentication and account management.
- GitHub API: To fetch repository and user details based on GitHub usernames.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
